                <p class="center">Food wastage is a global issue, and it's more critical now than ever to address it. Restaurants often have excess or unsold food at the end of the day, which usually ends up in the trash. With FoodConnect, we provide an efficient solution to prevent this waste by connecting restaurants to NGOs who can collect and distribute the surplus food to those in need.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Feeding the Hungry</h2>
                <p class="center">Millions of people around the world go to bed hungry every day, while perfectly good food is discarded. We believe that no one should suffer from hunger when there is enough food to go around. FoodConnect ensures that excess food reaches the tables of the less fortunate, ensuring a more equitable and compassionate society.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Community Impact</h2>
                <p class="center">By joining the FoodConnect network, restaurants and NGOs not only contribute to a reduction in food wastage and hunger but also make a positive impact on their local communities. This initiative fosters a sense of shared responsibility, making the world a better place one meal at a time.</p>
